# album-dl

This script downloads an album and tags the songs from a wikipedia page.  The programs asks for a youtube playlist and a wikipedia link to the album.  It will download the music, scrape the wiki page for metadata, and then tag the songs.  It is still limited in its features, but works for many cases nonetheless.
